## WHAT:
This is my entry to the AlgoExpert SWE Project Contest Summer-Fall 2020. It is a playful introduction into the very basics of the benefits of manipulating data sets. This is my first finished "real game" and also my first LOVE2d / Lua project. In addition, this is also my very first Git repo. All in all, there were a lot of firsts involved in working on this project. I have to say, I am quite happy with the result. Especially considering that I started working on this project only 13 days ago. I wanted to start as early as the end of July but as I was juggling different App and Web ideas and I was pretty bored by what I came up with, I naturally drifted to doing other things instead. Finally this idea came to me and I immediately went to work. Don't let the short timeframe fool you, though. It might have been only 13 days but I easily spent 150+ hours on this. Sadly, I had to scrap a lot of the planned features and content just because the deadline was approaching too fast. I hope that others can still find a little joy in playing this game. 

## HOW TO:
The build in the main folder is a Windows 64-bit commit. To play it, download all .dll files and the .exe into one folder and execute. It's as simple as that. The src is not needed to run the program but, as you might imagine, it's all the source files of my project in their bare form.* Since it's my first Lua distribution, I am happy enough that I got this to work before the end of the deadline. However, it seems like it would be fairly straightforward to make a MAC version, as well. In case it is wished for, I will leave that for after I submitted everything else, though.


*An effort has been made to delete dead code to make the files more presentable. Unfortunately, I couldn't keep up consistently commenting as my time started running out. 

Enjoy the game. And who knows, maybe you'll end up learning something while you're at it ;)
