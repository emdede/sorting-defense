## WHAT:
This is my entry for the AlgoExpert SWE Project Contest Summer-Fall 2020. It is a gamified introduction into the very basics of the benefits of manipulating data sets. This is my first finished "real game" and also my first LOVE2d / Lua project. In addition, this is also my very first Git repo. All in all, there were a lot of firsts involved in working on this project. I have to say, I am quite happy with the result. Especially considering that I started working on this only 13 days ago. I wanted to start as early as the end of July but as I was juggling different App and Web ideas and I was pretty bored by what I came up with, I naturally drifted to doing other things instead. Finally this idea hit and I immediately got to work. Don't let the short timeframe fool you, though. It might have been only 13 days but I easily spent 100+ hours on this. Sadly, I had to scrap a lot of the planned features and content just because the deadline was approaching too fast. But I hope that players can still feel entertained with this game. 

## HOW TO:
The build in the main folder is a Windows 64-bit commit. To play it, download all .dll files and the .exe into one folder and execute. It's as simple as that. The src is not needed to run the program but, as you might imagine, it's all the source files of my project in their bare form.* 

Update: I added a macOS version which can be found in the macOS folder. Full disclosure: I don't own a mac myself so I wasn't able to test it.


*An effort has been made to delete dead code to make the files more presentable. Unfortunately, I couldn't keep up consistently commenting as my time started running out. 

Enjoy the game. And who knows, maybe you'll end up learning something while you're at it ;)
