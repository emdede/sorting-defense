## WHAT:
This is my final project for Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science - CS50. It is a gamified introduction into the very basics of the benefits of manipulating data sets. This is my first finished "real game" and also my first LOVE2d / Lua project. In addition, this is also my very first Git repo. All in all, there were a lot of firsts involved in working on this project.

## HOW TO:
The build in the main folder is a Windows 64-bit commit. To play it, download all .dll files and the .exe into one folder and execute. It's as simple as that. The src is not needed to run the program but, as you might imagine, it's all the source files of my project in their bare form.* 

Update: I added a macOS version which can be found in the macOS folder. Full disclosure: I don't own a mac myself so I wasn't able to test it.


*An effort has been made to delete dead code to make the files more presentable. Unfortunately, I couldn't keep up consistently commenting as my time started running out. 

Enjoy the game. And who knows, maybe you'll end up learning something while you're at it ;)

UPDATE:
I discovered a bug that was breaking the Documentation feature.
