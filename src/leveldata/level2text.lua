        'Commander, I am sorry to have to wake you up. But our sensors are picking up another wave of those things closing in on our location.',
        'My team and I have concluded that the evidence so far is inconclusive. Either these obejects are consciously attacking us or we are drawing them in somehow, or both.',
        'I have ordered some of my staff to delve into the matter at hand and analyse what data we could gather so far. I hope they will come up with something useful that helps us in defending against the attackers.',

        'This is insanity. Why is this happening? This seems like a perfect time, however, to test out a new technology that I came up with. Well, technically, Miss Sheridan put the pieces together, but indeed you could say I was the torchbearer in the matter.',
        'We have added a BOMBER to your arsenal, Commander. Miss Sheridan said you should press \'Q\' to use it. I honestly have no idea what she means by that - she said, you\'d be able to figure it out. [PRESS Q TO BOMB ALL ENEMIES]'

        'Wow. That was ... beautiful. Great job, both by you and our esteemed Miss Sheridan. Apples do not fall far from trees, after all.',
        'Oh by the way, whenever you use the BOMBER, the systems need to cool down before you can use it again. Also, by design, it only hits enemies that are not actively hit by our cannon so it doesn\'t interfere with its workings.',
        'It seems like this was all of them... oh wait... right now I am getting a warning of even more objects approaching. Get to it, Commander.'

        'Nicely done. That must have been the last of them.',
        'I need to take a rest, Commander. All this thinking and delegating makes me sooo *YAWNS* tired. Take care and stay alert.'
