        'Another day, another step closer to deciphering the mysterious nature of our invaders. We are finally able to classify these objects. They can be referred to as ARRAYS or LISTS. You see, what my colleague found out that made us able to target them, indeed was on the money.',
        'It seems we are dealing with an alien species that employs a technology so powerful it allows them to create a shield that blocks all regular projectiles. But as always with things of cosmic beauty, there is a give-and-take. To be able to sustain the intense amount of power, they need to reroute their energy build-up through a core module.',
        'This core module is their weak point. It is randomly chosen and "hidden" inbetween all the other energy modules. Our sensors can locate them through spikes in energy levels but the cannon\'s projectiles have to find their way through a maze of those things to be able to reach the one vulnerable spot.',
        'These things seem to be growing bigger and bigger with every encounter. At this rate our simple search won\'t be able to cut the cheese. We are working hard to optimize the projectiles so they can find their target quicker.',
        'I hope that our defenses will hold until such time when we have made a breakthrough. Good luck to all of us, Commander.'

        'Commander, good news! We did it! We came up with a magnificent new kind of cannon. We call it the BUBBLE SORT CANNON, or BS in short. With this BS, we are able to SORT the enemies\' energy modules.',
        'The only caveat of this potent new technology is that it needs to be charged first. You can do so by holding the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON and releasing it when it is fully charged.',
        'We already have come up with an algorithm that lets us take advantage of this new configuration but let\'s not get ahead of ourselves. Please go ahead and sort this incoming data set.'
    },
    {
        'Aaahhh isn\'t that a beautiful sight to behold? Look at this neatly sorted array. You might also have noticed that the way our sorting beam interacts with an enemy, it is able to slow it down for a short amount of time.',
        'Now, it is time to witness the true potential of this new cannon. By clicking the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON while having this cannon selected you can now perform a BINARY SEARCH on the enemies. This is much faster than performing a linear search. BUT BEWARE: It is completely INEFFECTIVE against UNSORTED arrays.',
        'From now on you can switch between the two cannons by pressing 1 or 2 on your keyboard. For details on how this algorithm is implemented please go ahead and check the Docs.'

        'Phew, this new cannon really was a god-send. One moment later and we surely would have been done for. Great job as always, Commander.'
